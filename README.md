# Chilli-plant-leaf-disease-detection-using-machine-learning
This project uses Python and machine learning techniques to detect diseases in chilli plant leaves using image processing.Project Overview
Early detection of plant diseases is vital for ensuring better yield and sustainable agriculture. This project automates the process using image-based disease identification with machine learning, allowing efficient monitoring and early treatment.

Objectives

Improve accuracy of disease detection using ML and image processing

Develop a scalable solution for different chilli plant diseases

Classify and analyze disease patterns

Support decision-making for farmers through insights

Monitor disease resistance trends


Tools & Technologies

Python

TensorFlow

OpenCV

Anaconda

Jupyter Notebook

Methodology

Data Acquisition: Collect images of healthy and diseased chilli leaves

Preprocessing: Resize, enhance, and segment images

Feature Extraction: Identify key features of disease

Model Training: Use deep learning (CNNs) to learn patterns

Model Testing: Evaluate accuracy on unseen data

Classification: Predict type of disease based on input image
